## üéØ Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of **11 exceptional AI-assisted development workflows** that demonstrate cutting-edge agentic patterns for sophisticated software engineering. Each workflow uses **game theory** and systematic constraint to prevent common cognitive traps like analysis paralysis, bikeshedding, and perfectionism spirals while maintaining high quality outcomes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Git version control
- Claude API access (for AI-powered workflows)
- Basic understanding of game theory concepts (optional but helpful)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/advanced-agentic-workflows.git
cd advanced-agentic-workflows
pnpm install
```

### Run Your First Workflow
```bash
# Quick code review game
./tools/workflow-runner.js code-review-game "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123"

# Feature discovery for a new capability
./tools/workflow-runner.js feature-discovery "Add real-time collaboration to code editor"

# Emergency debugging with Ulysses Protocol
./tools/workflow-runner.js ulysses-protocol "Fix critical MCP integration causing workflow failures"
```

### Sequential Refactoring Server

This example server mirrors the sequential processing flow of the Clear Thought
server but for code refactoring tasks. Start the server:

```bash
node agentic-scripts/refactoring/sequential-refactor-server.js
```

Create a new session:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sessions
```

Add a refactoring step (replace `<id>` with the returned session ID):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/sessions/<id>/step \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"Extract function","stepNumber":1,"totalSteps":3}'
```

Retrieve all steps for a session:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/sessions/<id>
```

Check server health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```
