## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of **8 exceptional AI-assisted development workflows** that demonstrate cutting-edge agentic patterns for sophisticated software engineering. Each workflow uses **game theory** to prevent common cognitive traps like analysis paralysis, bikeshedding, and perfectionism spirals while maintaining high quality outcomes.

## 🏆 Featured Workflows
