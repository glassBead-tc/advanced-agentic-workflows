# Why Reynard Playbooks?

These playbooks encode game-theoretic development methods that prevent cognitive traps such as analysis paralysis, bikeshedding, and perfectionism spirals while maintaining quality outcomes. They emphasize:

- Energy/budget systems to constrain effort
- Multi-agent coordination with attention auctions
- Anti-spiral detection and familiarity preservation
